<h1>Headings</h1>
<p> HTML has six "levels" of headings<br/>
     (h1) is used for main headings
     (h2) is used for subheadings
     If there are further sections 
    under the subheadings then the 
    (h3) element is used . The 
    contents of an (h1) element is 
    the largest, and the contents of 
    an (6) element is the smallest</p>
<h2>Example</h2>

<h5>This is a Level 5 Heading</h5>
